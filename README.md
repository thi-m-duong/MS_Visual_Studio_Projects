# MS_Visual_Studio_Projects
<p>A collection of selected Microsoft Visual Studio team and individual projects I did in college in my senior year. The coffee order application was one of my favorites.</p>
<p>About each project:</p>
<li><strong>Coffee Order Application: </strong>Java Heaven is a coffee house specializing in several types of flavored coffees and syrups. The management of this business needs a program to help them calculate and accumulate coffee sales. A VB form and the module of code were created to allow employees to calculate sales for coffee.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Database Management Application: </strong>Created an application to track and manage customer data. Project detailed requirements are included in this repository under Requirements_Part_1 and Requirements_Part_2. Part 1 includes creating and designing the data model, validating the data, and then populating the CUSTOMER table by keying information for at least twenty fictitious customers, again with a unique customer number as the unique key. Part 2 is the core of this project requiring to design and build the interface and code module on Visual Studio.</li>
<li><strong>Fibonacci Prime Generator Application: </strong>The app is a math calculator, which will allow the user to enter one or two positive integers and click a button of choice to view the solution. The button choices include: <i>Sum, Difference, Product, Quotient, Multiplication Table, Average, Min, Max, Exponentiation, Wild Card, Asc Sort, Prime, Fibonacci, Factorial, and Exit.</i>
    The technical requirements include:
    <ul><li>An array must be used to store the Fibonacci sequence. Use a one-dimensional array and a loop to calculate and load the fibonacci values. Write the results to the output control.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The app must have all of the good coding standards learned to date; including, allowing only integers and the backspace key for user entry, error handling (with messages), exit confirmation, automatic selection of text in textboxes, and automatic clearing of outputs when new inputs are entered, etc.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The app must incorporate the UI/UX standards we have learned to date in this course.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The app must adhere to proper declaration of variables and constants.</li></ul>
    
</li>
